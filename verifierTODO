# Pre-requisities:
# - apt-file (do apt-file update at run)
# - 

#1. See content of /sbin /bin /usr/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin
#2. Select some of the binaries or all (follow symlinks?)
#3. Use the name and path of binary to get the package: apt-file search $NAME|grep "$NAME$"|cut -d':' -f1
# - If more than one binaries are in the package group them
#4. Check if the package is installed with apt-cache search
# - if there is a newer version, force to download the current version of the package
# - if not possible, suggest upgrading?
#5. Add the full package name into the list including version
#6. When all binaries are searched for and names are added to list download with: apt-get
#7. For each binary-package pair, extract the control.tar.gz with: ar -x control.tar.gz
#8. Calculate md5sum of the binary and using the latter field, grep the correct sum from control.tar.gz/md5sums -file
#9. Report result of comparison
